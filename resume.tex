	\section{Summary}
	Software Engineer, Front-end, with 8+ years of experience across a broad spectrum of projects and technologies. As an agile culture enthusiast, I encourage collaboration between customers and teams, making communication a strong pillar to rely on. I started as a back-end engineer but my excitement for user interfaces and user satisfaction led me to become a front-end engineer. I truly enjoy breaking down complex concepts into small, understandable pieces of knowledge to help clarify interaction between coworkers with different backgrounds and skill sets.
